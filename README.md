hnapi-users
===========

https://github.com/hnapi-users/hnapi-users is an unofficial documentation, issue tracking, and code snippet repository for users of the Hacker News APIs.

Our scope covers the new Firebase API, HTML page scrapers, and the older Algolia API.

This repository is intended to be temporary, persisting only until an official public user support channel is launched.

### HN API Comparisons

Each API differs in which lists (e.g.: News, Newest, Most Active), and which data fields for items (e.g.: title, score, number of comments) are available.
