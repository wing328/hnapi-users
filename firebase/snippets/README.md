# Firebase API Snippets

- **count_children.js** is a Node script that uses the Firebase API to, well, count the children of an item. This is the only hard thing to do with the Firebase API. Note that this script makes hundreds of API calls to recursively descend the child tree. **Don't do this!** but it's interesting.
