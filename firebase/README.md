# Firebase

The HN Firebase API is the new way forward, but v0 is missing a few things that some of us count on. See API Comparisons ([lists](/pages/list_data_availability) and [items](/pages/item_data_availability)) for details.

The Firebase API has many significant advantages over HTML scrapers and the Algolia API, so hopefully we'll be able to move all functionality over in the near future.
